refactor(logger): drop pino dependency, default to `ConsoleLoggerProvider`

`@forinda/kickjs` no longer ships pino or pino-pretty. The default logger is now `ConsoleLoggerProvider`, which routes through `console.*` and has zero runtime dependencies. The pluggable `LoggerProvider` interface is unchanged — adopters who want pino, winston, bunyan, or anything else implement the same five-method contract and call `Logger.setProvider()` before `bootstrap()`. See `docs/guide/logging.md` for Pino, Winston, and silent-logger recipes.

**Behavioural change for adopters relying on the default**: log lines lose pino's JSON envelope and `pino-pretty` colors. The new format is `[ComponentName] message`. If you depend on pino's output shape (structured fields, transports, log-aggregator-friendly JSON), copy the ~15-line PinoProvider snippet from `docs/guide/logging.md` and call `Logger.setProvider(new PinoProvider())` at startup.

**Removed exports**: the `rootLogger` re-export from `@forinda/kickjs` and the `PinoLoggerProvider` class. The `LoggerProvider` interface, `ConsoleLoggerProvider`, `Logger`, and `createLogger` are unchanged.

**CLI scaffolds**: `kick new` no longer pre-installs `pino` / `pino-pretty`, and the generated `vite.config.ts` no longer needs `ssr.external: ['pino', 'pino-pretty']`. Existing projects keep working without changes.
