'@forinda/kickjs-devtools': patch

Import `DEVTOOLS_BUS` from the new `@forinda/kickjs-devtools-kit/bus/token` subpath instead of `/bus`. The SPA bundle drops from **1025 kB to 92 kB** now that the framework runtime is no longer transitively pulled through the bus re-export.

Test fix: vitest aliases switched to anchored regex so longer subpaths match before shorter ones (the previous string-prefix alias rewrote `/bus/token` into `bus.ts/token` and threw `ENOTDIR`).
