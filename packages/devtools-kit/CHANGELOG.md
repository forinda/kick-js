## 5.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#240](https://github.com/forinda/kick-js/pull/240) [`4eebd43`](https://github.com/forinda/kick-js/commit/4eebd43f259c1d5b7214acd46efc6c6d277ee82f) Thanks [@forinda](https://github.com/forinda)! - fix(devtools): two audit-found correctness wins

  **`routeLatency` map no longer grows unboundedly under 404 probing**
  (`@forinda/kickjs-devtools`).

  The request-tracking middleware keyed `routeLatency` by
  `${req.method} ${req.route?.path ?? req.path}` — when no route matched,
  the fallback used the raw URL, so every probed 404 path became its own
  entry. The samples ring buffer was capped at 1000, but the map itself
  had no cap; an attacker hammering random paths could inflate
  `/_debug/metrics` payloads and leak memory indefinitely. Unmatched
  requests now collapse into a single `<unmatched>` bucket per HTTP
  method.

  **`DEVTOOLS_BUS` token doc drift** (`@forinda/kickjs-devtools-kit`).

  The JSDoc claimed the adapter registered the bus in `beforeStart`, but
  it actually registers in `beforeMount`. Doc-only fix — no runtime
  change.

### Patch Changes

- [#166](https://github.com/forinda/kick-js/pull/166) [`a6d0dd6`](https://github.com/forinda/kick-js/commit/a6d0dd6038b215c0ae3cbe1a20e11ba0d8b1c46e) Thanks [@forinda](https://github.com/forinda)! - Minify published build output via the tsdown / oxc minifier.
  - **Library packages** use `minify: { compress: true, mangle: false }`. Whitespace and comments are stripped and constants folded, but identifiers stay intact so adopter stack traces remain readable.
  - **CLI** uses `minify: { compress: true, mangle: true }`. The CLI is an operator tool, not a library — full mangle is fine and gives a smaller binary.

  Net effect: roughly 30–40% smaller `dist/*.mjs` per package on disk, no public-API or behavior change.

## 5.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#161](https://github.com/forinda/kick-js/pull/161) [`5de61d9`](https://github.com/forinda/kick-js/commit/5de61d9a9cd99bac3e1e271a36b092fa7bf7ad98) Thanks [@forinda](https://github.com/forinda)! - Add `@forinda/kickjs-devtools-kit/bus/token` subpath that exports `DEVTOOLS_BUS` separately from the bus runtime. Browser SPAs and other framework-free consumers can now import from `/bus` without pulling `createToken` (and through it the entire `@forinda/kickjs` runtime) into their bundle. Server-side adapters and plugins that need the DI token import it from `/bus/token`.

  The README now documents every subpath (`.`, `/runtime`, `/types`, `/bus`, `/bus/token`) with whether each one pulls in the framework, and the lockstep-versioning claim has been replaced with the Changesets-based flow.
